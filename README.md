# Gara-Social-Media
GARA  is an Ethiopian based social media platform made with the MERN Stack (MongoDb, Express, ReactJs, NodeJs )

I started it as a way to teach myself fullstack development as many senior developers insisted that the best way to learn programming is by doing projects.
Though this project is not done. It lacks some routes as I'm yet to finish the landing page. Though overall, I would say the project is 70% finished.
